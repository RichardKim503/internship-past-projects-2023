I will not be going for extra credit.


1. How much time did you spend working on this project?
About 5 hours.


2. Who, if anyone, helped you with this project?
I learned to how to read data from "rrdata.txt" from you, professor. I also
read online about the Scanner API to learn how to use some of the methods
such as hasNextLine(), nextLine(), hasNextInt(), etc.


3. What was the most difficult part of this project?
The most difficult part of the project was learning how to use the File object.
At first, I had no idea how to read data from "rrdata.txt". But once I had figured
it out, I had trouble with creating an object from a String and adding ridership
data with the int. I would always skip of data using the nextLine() method. Then
I learned that using a temporary variable that holds one line of data does not
skip data and I managed to figure out how to read one line of data at a time.


4. Describe how you convinced yourself that your program works.
Before I used the data from "rrdata.txt", I created many objects using the source
code that I had made. I used all three constructors and I made sure that the data
that was being used was valid. So arrays that would have more than 20 indexes would
stop at day 20 and all the other days would be disregarded. I also tested out every
single method to make sure that I got the correct output. Once I got everything to
work and the File Scanner to work, I put my custom stations in the text file to
further test out my source code to make sure everything worked. I also made sure
that the sample output matched my output.
