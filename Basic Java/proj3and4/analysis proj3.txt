1. How long did it take you to complete this project?
About 3 hours.


2. What kind of help did you receive on this project, and from whom?
I used zybooks to get help with the random class. Other than that,
I worked on this project by myself.


3. What was the most difficult challenge you faced in this project?
Creating the parameterized constructor was actually tricky for me.
I went through about two iterations of the parameterized constructor
until I was happy with how it worked. Making the constructor check for
invalid inputs such as numbers that were greater than 12 or less than 0,
or attempts to multiply were challenging at first. But I used a variable
that would force all three instance variables to randomize if it was true.
After doing that, I had an easier time with the paramterized constructor
and it worked out in the end.


4. Why did you test the parameterized constructor the amount of times that you did?
Are you confident that you tested all possible combinations of valid and invalid
parameters?
I tested the parameterized constructor 21 times, 10 times with valid parameters
and 11 times with invalid. I tested the constructor with 10 valid parameters
to make sure that all the numbers within the designated range in part 2 of the
project came out corrected. Then I tested for invalid parameters. This included
numbers that were not in the range in part 2, multiplication problems, division,
negative numbers, and results that were negatives. Those parameters would output
random questions instead. I'm confident that I tested all possible combinations
because I tested many parameters that were in the allowed range and others that
were not allowed as well.
