I will not seek extra credit.


1. How much time did you spend working on this project?
About 1 and a half hours.


2. Who, if anyone, helped you with this project?
I worked on this project by myself.


3. What was the most difficult part of this project?
I didn't face any challenges with the project for the most part.


4. Describe how you convinced yourself that your program works.
I ran the code many times to make sure that the output was the same
as the one in the instruction pdf. I also purposefully inputted wrong
answers to make sure that the user got the right message when their
answer was incorrect. When I was building the code, I tested each
portion of the code one at a time to make sure that each part was
working correctly as well.
