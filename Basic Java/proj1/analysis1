1. How much time did you spend working on this project?
At most two hours.

2. Who, if anyone, helped you with this project?
I worked on this project by myself.

3. What was the most difficult part of this project?
To be honest, this project wasn't that hard. But tracing was very tedious for me.
Adapting to the Eclipse IDE from another IDE I used in high school was also
an obstacle, but I adapted within a few minutes.

4. Is there anything about your submission that you’re unhappy with?
I feel that my comments could've been better since I didn't use comments as much back in my high school.
But other than that, I think that my code works well.
